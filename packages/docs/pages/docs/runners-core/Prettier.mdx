# Prettier 

> **An Opinionated Code Formatter**

This runner creates the Prettier configuration and corresponding Webpack rule that, unmodified, is identical 
to that in `create-react-app`.  You may add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-prettier) is a common runner that is automatically
included  by BeRun starter templates such as [`@berun/template-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/template-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-prettier
```

```js
// berun.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-prettier']
}
```

## Example usage

```js
  berun.prettier.ignorePath('.gitignore')
```
