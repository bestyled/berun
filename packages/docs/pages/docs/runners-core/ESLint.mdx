# ESLint 

> **Pluggable JavaScript linter**

This runner creates the ESLint configuration and corresponding Webpack rule that, unmodified, is identical 
to that in `create-react-app`.  You may add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-eslint) is a common runner that is automatically
included by BeRun starter templates such as [`@berun/template-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/template-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-eslint
```

```js
// berun.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-eslint']
}
```

## Example usage

```js
  berun.webpack.module
    .rule('eslint')
    .test(/\.(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)$/)

  berun.eslint.formatter(eslintFormatter)  
```
