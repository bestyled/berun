# Jest

> **Delightful JavaScript Testing**

This runner creates the Jest configuration that, unmodified, is identical 
to that in `create-react-app`.  You may add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-jest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-jest) is a common runner that is automatically
included by BeRun presets such as [`@berun/preset-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/preset-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-jest
```

```js
// berun.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-jest']
}
```


## Example usage

```js
  berun.jest.collectCoverageFrom.add('src/**/*.{ts,tsx}').end()
```
