# Runners

Runners are the core building block of BeRun, otherwise known as middleware or presets.

A runner typically manages one build tool or one build task, and does it well.  One runner 
may be composed of multiple other runners.   

Each runner will include the necessary `@berun/fluent` api for its toolset, so if for example you
include `@berun/runner-babel` there is no need to include `@berun/fluent-babel` as well.

## Official Core Runners 

* Babel
* ESLint
* Fuse-Box
* Prettier
* TSLint
* Webpack

Many other runners may be provided by the community or added to this list over time.
