# Fuse-Box

> **A bundler that does it right**

This runner creates the Fuse-Box configuration that, unmodified, is equivalent to the Webpack configuration 
in `create-react-app`.  You may add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-fuse-box`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-fuse-box) is a common runner that is automatically
included by BeRun presets such as [`@berun/preset-fuse-box-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/preset-fuse-box-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-fuse-box
```

```js
// berun.config.ts
export default {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-fuse-box']
}
```

## Example usage

```js
  berun.fusebox
      .bundle('vendor')
      .instructions(`~ ${appIndexJs}`)
      .end()
      .bundle('app')
      .instructions(`!> [${appIndexJs}]`)
      .end()
```
