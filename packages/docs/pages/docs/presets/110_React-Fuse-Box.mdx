# Fuse-Box React

> **React preset using Fuse-Box, modeled after `create-react-app`**

This preset creates a configuration that, unmodified, is identical to `create-react-app`, except
that Fuse-Box is used instead of Webpack.   You may add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

Fuse-Box is generally much faster than Webpack for both cold and warm builds.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/preset-fuse-box-react
```

```js
// berun.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: [ '@berun/preset-fuse-box-react']
}
```

## Included build tools

* Fuse-Box
* Babel v7+ and/or TypeScript
* Jest 

## Sparky tasks

```bash
# Run development server on localhost:3000
npm start

# Production build
npm run build
```
