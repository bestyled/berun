# Core Concepts

BeRun is a platform that provides a configurable build pipeline for modern javascript oriented applications
and components.

There are a number of core concepts that are described here:

- [**Getting Started**](./Create) -- the one line `yarn create berun` command to create new projects using recommended boilerplate settings;  very similar to `create-react-app`
- [**Customization**](./Customization) -- the ability to tweak build configuration without forking or ejecting
- [**Project Layout**](./Layout) -- directory layout that BeRun expects (like everything, configurable)
- [**Presets**](./Presets) -- common build configurations for React Javascript, Typescript and Markdown projects
- [**Runners**](./Runners) -- build configurations for common build tools or common build tasks
- [**Scripts**](./Scripts) -- a command line execution environment that can be called as `npm` scripts
- [**Sparky**](./Sparky) -- a fully featured task runner that powers BeRun Scripts

## Documentation

In addition to the core concepts, documentation is provided on 

- **Contribution** guidelines
- the **Fluent API** that BeRun uses to configure all build tools in a consistent, tweakable way
- the official **Presets** and **Runners** included (in addition to community provided plugins)
- the official **Starter Kit Templates** available
