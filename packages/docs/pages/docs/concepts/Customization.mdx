# Customization

No two JavaScript projects are ever the same, and as such there may be times when you will need to make modifications
to the way your BeRun runners are building your project. BeRun provides a mechanism to augment presets and
runners in the context of a project without resorting to creating and publishing an entirely independent preset.

## `./config/berun.config.ts`

First, you will need to create a `./config/berun.config.ts` file in the root of your project. You
[may have already done this](./usage.md#using-multiple-presets) if you specified your middleware via `./config/berun.config.ts`
as opposed to CLI `--use`.

The `./config/berun.config.ts` file is picked up by BeRun automatically if it exists. This can simplify your BeRun commands
by making them as simple as `berun start` or `berun build`. If you do all your customization within
`./config/berun.config.ts`, the CLI will pick up these changes every time you run it.

### Runner formats

Before we delve into making customizations in `./config/berun.config.ts`, it's important to note that this file can be in any
valid [middleware format](./middleware.md#formats) that BeRun accepts. For project-based customization, it is
recommended to use the object format, and that will be the format we focus on for the remainder of this guide. Should
you need a lot of API customization, you may still opt to write your `./config/berun.config.ts` file in the function format.

Your `./config/berun.config.ts` file is a JavaScript module which will be required by BeRun using Node.js. Any code written in
this file should be usable by the version of Node.js you have running on your system when running BeRun. The
`./config/berun.config.ts` file should export an object or function depending on which format you opt to use.

```js
export default {
  /* make customizations */
};
```

```js
export default (berun) => {
  /* make customizations */
};
```

**In a nutshell, the `./config/berun.config.ts` file is wholly runners**.

## Using middleware

By specifying a `use` array in your `./config/berun.config.ts`, you can inform BeRun to load additional runners when it
runs, including any additional files you wish to include as middleware. Each item in this `use` array can be any
BeRun-supported [middleware format](./Runners.mdx#formats).

In its simplest form, each item can be the string module name or path to middleware you wish BeRun to require and
use for you:

```js
export default {
  use: [
    '@berun/preset-react',
    '@berun/eslint',
    '@berun/prettier',
    './override.js'
  ]
};
```

If your middleware module supports its own options, instead of referencing it by string, use an array pair of string
module name and options:

```js
export default {
  use: [
    ['@berun/runner-eslint', {
      eslint: {
        rules: {
          semi: 'off'
        }
      }
    }],

    ['@berun/preset-react', {
      html: { title: 'Epic React App' }
    }]
  ]
};
```

If you need to make more advanced configuration changes, you can even directly pass a function as middleware to `use`
and have access to the BeRun API:

```js
export default {
  use: [
    '@berun/preset-react',
    '@berun/runner-eslint',
    (berun) => berun.webpack.module
      .rule('style')
      .use('css')
      .options({ modules: true })
  ]
};
```

## Environment-specific overrides

Sometimes you can only make certain configuration changes in certain Node.js environments, or you may choose to
selectively make changes based on the values of any arbitrary environment variable. These can be done from
`./config/berun.config.ts` using the `env` property. Each property within `env` maps to an environment variable with key-values
mapping to  environment values which contain further middleware. This works for any environment variable, not just
`NODE_ENV`.

For example, if you wanted to include additional middleware when `NODE_ENV` is `production`:

```js
export default {
  env: {
    NODE_ENV: {
      production: {
        use: ['@berun/runner-pwa']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

_Example: Turn on CSS modules when the environment variable `CSS_MODULES=enable`:_

```js
export default {
  env: {
    CSS_MODULES: {
      // Turn on CSS modules when the environment variable CSS_MODULES=enable
      enable: (berun) => {
        berun.webpack.module
          .rule('style')
            .use('css')
              .options({ modules: true });
      }
    }
  }
};
```

You may use any middleware format as the value for the matching environment-value mapping.

## Advanced configuration changes

Making deep or complex changes to BeRun build configuration beyond what middleware options afford you can be done
using the function middleware format. If you wish, your entire `./config/berun.config.ts` file can be a middleware function, but
typically this function can be inlined directly as an additional item in the `use` array.

If you're familiar with middleware from the Express/connect world, this works similarly. When using Express middleware,
you provide a function to Express which receives arguments to modify a request or response along its lifecycle. There
can be a number of middleware functions that Express can load, each one potentially modifying a request or response in
succession.

When you add a middleware function to `use`, this is typically used to override BeRun's configuration, and you can
add as many functions as you wish in succession. Every preset or middleware that BeRun has loaded follows this same
middleware successive pipeline.

The BeRun API instance provided to your function has a `config` property that is an instance of
[berun](https://github.com/bestyled/berun). We won't go in-depth of all the configuration
possibilities here, but encourage you to check out the documentation for [BeRun Fluent](https://github.com/bestyled/berun/master/packages/fluent)for instructions on your
particular use case. Just know that you can use [BeRun Fluent Webpack](https://github.com/bestyled/berun/master/packages/fluent-webpack)to modify any part of the underlying webpack configuration
using its API.

This `berun.config` is an accumulation of all configuration up to this moment. All BeRun middleware and presets
interact with and make changes through this config, which is all available to you. For example, if you are using the
presets `@berun/preset-react`, any config set can be extended, manipulated, or removed.

_Example: BeRun's React preset adds `.jsx` as a module extension. Let's remove it._

```js
export default {
  use: [
    '@berun/preset-react',
    (berun) => berun.webpack.resolve.extensions.delete('.jsx')
  ]
};
```

_Example: BeRun's Node.js preset has performance hints disabled. Let's re-enable them._

```js
export default {
  use: [
    '@berun/node',
    (berun) => berun.webpack.performance.hints('error')
  ]
};
```

Remember, middleware can also have their own custom options for making some changes easier without having to resort to
interacting with the BeRun API; see your respective middleware for details. See the [documentation on the
configuration API using @berun/fluent](./@berun/fluent.md) for all ways you can modify a config instance to solve
your use cases.

### Conditional configuration

Some plugins and rules are only available in certain environments. For example, the Web preset only exposes a `optimize-css`
plugin during production, leading to issues when trying to modify its settings, but throws an exception during
development.

_Example: Remove all webpack arguments to the `optimize-css` plugin when using the Web preset._

```js
berun.webpack.when(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', webpack => {
  webpack.plugin('optimize-css').tap(args => []);
});
```
