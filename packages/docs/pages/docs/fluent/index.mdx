# Fluent API

Use a fluent API to generate and simplify the modification of
Webpack, Babel, Jest and other build tool configurations.

Note: while [`@berun/fluent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/fluent) is utilized extensively in `@berun`, this package is
completely standalone and can be used by any project.

## Introduction

Most commonly used build tool configurations are based on creating and modifying a
potentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is okay for configurations
on individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and
make subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep
understanding of the underlying object structure to make those changes.

[`@berun/fluent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/fluent) attempts to improve 
this process by providing a chainable or
['fluent interface'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) for creating and modifying webpack configurations. 
Key portions of the API can be referenced by user-specified names, which helps to
standardize how to modify a configuration across projects.

This is easier explained through the examples following which show configuration for Webpack,
but the process is the same for other tools.

## Installation

[`@berun/fluent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/fluent) requires Node.js v8.3 and higher. 

You may install this package using either Yarn or npm (choose one):

**Yarn**

```bash
yarn add @berun/fluent-webpack
```

**npm**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @berun/fluent-webpack
```

## Getting Started

Once you have `@berun/fluent-webpack` installed, you can start creating a
webpack configuration.

```js
// Require the @berun-webpack module. This module exports a single
// berun runner for adding the webpack configuration API to berun.
const webpack = require('@berun/fluent-webpack');

// Instantiate the configuration with a new API on the berun object
berun.use(webpack);

// Make configuration changes using the chain API.
// Every API call tracks a change to the stored configuration.

berun.webpack
  // Interact with entry points
  .entry('index')
    .add('src/index.ts')
    .end()
  // Modify output settings
  .output
    .path('dist')
    .filename('[name].bundle.js');

// Create named rules which can be modified later
berun.webpack.module
  .rule('lint')
    .test(/\.js$/)
    .pre()
    .include
      .add('src')
      .end()
    // Even create named uses (loaders)
    .use('eslint')
      .loader('eslint-loader')
      .options({
        rules: {
          semi: 'off'
        }
      });

berun.webpack.module
  .rule('compile')
    .test(/\.js$/)
    .include
      .add('src')
      .add('test')
      .end()
    .use('babel')
      .loader('babel-loader')
      .options({
        presets: [
          ['@babel/preset-env', { modules: false }]
        ]
      });

// Create named plugins too!
berun.webpack
  .plugin('clean')
    .use(CleanPlugin, [['dist'], { root: '/dir' }]);

```
