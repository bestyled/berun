# Docs Starter Template

Templates are boilerplate starter projects that contain all of the essential elements 
that are required to start building applications and component libraries.

This allows you to set up a modern static website by running one command.

The @berun Docs starter template includes

* @BeStatic static site generator framework, based on React with hot reloading and no Javascript
* React (latest version)
* Webpack 4
* Babel 7
* Jest
* ESLint and Prettier
* All the appropriate optimizations and configurations from `create-react-app` but applied to static website generation.

It's a bit like `Gatsby`, `react-static`, `next.js` but with one line installation, hot-reloading, no bloated 
Javascript included at runtime, and even the ability to run directly alongside any other React application without
version conflicts of build tools such as webpack (as it uses the exact same build pipeline)

### Install
 
```bash
$ yarn create berun myapp @berun/template-docs
```

### View documentation with hot reloading

```bash
$ cd myapp
$ yarn start
```

### Publish (to `/build` directory)

```bash
$ cd myapp
$ yarn build
```


## configurations

See the `./config/berun.config.ts` and `./config/bestatic.config.js` for configuration of the build pipeline
and static site generator respectively.
