# Starter Kit Templates

Templates are boilerplate starter projects that contain all of the essential elements 
that are required to start building applications and component libraries.

This allows you to set up a modern web app by running one command.

## Official Templates Included
 
* [React](./100_React) -- Set up a modern web app similar to `create-react-app`
* [React Typescript](./110_React-TS) -- Setup a modern web app with a modern statically typed language
* [Docs](./400_Docs) -- Setup a modern, static, content-driven website, themed and attractive out of the box
