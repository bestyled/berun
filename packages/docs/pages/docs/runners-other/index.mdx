# Runners

Runners are the core building block of BeRun, otherwise known as middleware or presets.

A runner typically manages one build tool or one build task, and does it well.  One runner 
may be composed of multiple other runners.   

Each runner will include the necessary `@berun/fluent` api for its toolset, so if for example you
include `@berun/runner-babel` there is no need to include `@berun/fluent-babel` as well.

## Official Utility Runners
 
* Mdx -- process JSX in Markdown and regular Markdown files
* Mdx Front Matter -- parse front matter in Mdx / Markdown files
* Static -- run build tool (Webpack) in two passes to generate static HTML only
* TSMain -- Allow build tool to pick up `ts:main` references as well as `main` in package.json dependencies
* Web Polyfills -- Included standard web polyfills for older browsers
* Webpack CSS -- Include CSS pre-processors (e.g., Sass), not needed for CSS in JS solutions

Many other runners may be provided by the community or added to this list over time.
