# Web Polyfills

> **Support older target Javascript environments**

This runner creates the necessary Webpack configuration and source code to support Web polyfills, 
that, unmodified, are identical to those in `create-react-app`.  You may fork and amend this package to 
adjust the polyfill code included.

Polyfills are not required in the most modern browsers, so we have split out these polyfills into this
small standalone runner to makes its inclusion optional.   


## Included polyfills

* Promises
* Fetch
* `Object.assign`
* `for...of`
* `...Set`, `...Map`
* requestAnimationFrame (test environment only)

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-web-polyfills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-web-polyfills) is a common runner that is automatically
included by BeRun presets such as [`@berun/preset-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/preset-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-web-polyfills
```

```js
// berun.config.ts
export default {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-web-polyfills']
}
```

## Usage

Once included in the BeRun configuration, no further action is necessary.   Each polyfill will
automatically be loaded in the web browser environment if unsupported natively by the client's browser.
