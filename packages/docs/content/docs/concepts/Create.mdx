# Getting Started

## Create New Project

The `create-berun` package allows an entire boilerplate project with modern configuration
best practices to be setup in a single command without local or global installation of any packages.

```bash
# setup project structure
$ yarn create berun myapp

# change directory to newly setup project
$ cd myapp

# start dev server
$ yarn start
```

See [Starter Kit Templates](../templates) for available boilerplates.  

## Customization

The defaul boilerplate is a modern React template, equivent to that created by `create-react-app`.   You can tweak
it with additional wepback or babel plugins by adjusting the `./config/berun.config.ts` file.
