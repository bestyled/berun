# Babel

> **Use next generation JavaScript, today**

This runner creates the Babel configuration that, unmodified, is identical to that in `create-react-app`.  You may
add or subtract to it to configure it exactly as needed.

## Installation

[`@berun/runner-babel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/runner-babel) is a common runner that is automatically
included by BeRun presets such as [`@berun/preset-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@berun/preset-react).   If you 
need to install it directly, follow these directions:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @berun/runner-babel
```

```js
// berun.config.ts
export default {
  use: [ '@berun/runner-babel']
}
```

## Example usage

```js
expect(berun.babel.toConfig()).toEqual({
    babelrc: false,
    presets: ['@berun/babel-preset-react-app'],
    highlightCode: true,
    compact: false
  })
```
